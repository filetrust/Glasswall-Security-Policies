## 1.0 Overview

Cloud Services provide a cost effective and efficient method of scaling the resources required to support customers and the Company, for example using Microsoft Azure to achieve at scale computing power, without the requirement to purchase and operate expensive computer equipment.

However, without robust controls and processes to protect Company data, there is risk of exposure to online threats such as data loss, or theft and unauthorised access to Company networks.

Cloud Services provided by a third party are typically have the following delivery models;
- Infrastructure as a Service	(IaaS)
- Software as a Service	        (SaaS)
- Platform as a Service	        (PaaS)
- Network as a Service	        (NaaS)

Cloud Services are typically provided via the following deployment models:
- Private cloud; where services are managed by the Company on a third-party platform.
- Public cloud; where services are provided and managed entirely by a third party.
- Hybrid cloud; where services are provided partly by the Company in a private cloud and partly provided by a third party in the public or private cloud.
